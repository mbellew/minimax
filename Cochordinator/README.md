### Cochordinator 

This feels like a grab bag, but I find it useful for a variety of tracks using various generative sequencing/progressions expreiments.

1) (optionally) transpose incoming notes to specified key (from C)
2) quantize to specified key
3) (optionally) output a chord using incoming note as the root
4) (optionally,experimental) arpeggiate chord using incoming triggers
